# - A paranoia level of 1 is default. In this level, most core rules
#   are enabled. PL1 is advised for beginners, installations
#   covering many different sites and applications, and for setups
#   with standard security requirements.
#   At PL1 you should face FPs rarely. If you encounter FPs, please
#   open an issue on the CRS GitHub site and don't forget to attach your
#   complete Audit Log record for the request with the issue.
# - Paranoia level 2 includes many extra rules, for instance enabling
#   many regexp-based SQL and XSS injection protections, and adding
#   extra keywords checked for code injections. PL2 is advised
#   for moderate to experienced users desiring more complete coverage
#   and for installations with elevated security requirements.
#   PL2 comes with some FPs which you need to handle.
# - Paranoia level 3 enables more rules and keyword lists, and tweaks
#   limits on special characters used. PL3 is aimed at users experienced
#   at the handling of FPs and at installations with a high security
#   requirement.
# - Paranoia level 4 further restricts special characters.
#   The highest level is advised for experienced users protecting
#   installations with very high security requirements. Running PL4 will
#   likely produce a very high number of FPs which have to be
#   treated before the site can go productive.

# The default values for the PCRE Match limit are very, very low with ModSecurity. 
# You can got to 500K usually without harming your set.
# But for your information: 
# The PCRE Match limit is meant to reduce the chance for a DoS attack via 
# Regular Expressions. So by raising the limit you raise your vulnerability in this regard, 
# but the PCRE errors are much worse from a security perspective. I run with 500K in prod usually.
